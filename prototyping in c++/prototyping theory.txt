Function prototyping is a function declaration statement that tells the compiler about the return type of the function and the number as well as type of 
arguments required by the function at the time of calling it.

The Function prototype serves the following purposes â€“ 
1) It tells the return type of the data that the function will return. 
2) It tells the number of arguments passed to the function. 
3) It tells the data types of each of the passed arguments. 
4) Also it tells the order in which the arguments are passed to the function.
Therefore essentially, the function prototype specifies the input/output interlace to the function i.e. what to give to the function and what to expect from 
the function.

Advantages of function prototype :
- It helps the compiler in determining whether a function is called correctly or not. Each time when a function is called, its calling statement is compared
  with its prototype. In case of any mismatch, compiler reports an error.
- A function must be defined before calling it. But prototyping allows a function to be called before defining it.
