A function that is declared static using the ‘static‘ keyword becomes a static function in C++.

Syntax of the Static Function:

static <return_type> <function_name>(<arguments>)
When a function inside a class is declared as static, it can be accessed outside the class using the class name and scope resolution operator (::), without creating
any object.

A static member method has access only to the static members of the class, we can not call any non-static functions inside it.

All objects in the class share the same copy of the static function. It is useful in manipulating global static variables, which are again shared by all objects.

Since the static function is not bounded by the object of the class, it does not has access to the this keyword.
