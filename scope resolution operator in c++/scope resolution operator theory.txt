In C++, scope resolution operator is ::. The scope resolution operator is used to reference the global variable or member function that is out of scope. 
Therefore, we use the scope resolution operator to access the hidden variable or function of a program.
For example, when the global and local variable or function has the same name in a program, and when we call the variable, by default it only accesses 
the inner or local variable without calling the global variable. In this way, it hides the global variable or function. To overcome this situation, we use 
the scope resolution operator to fetch a program's hidden variable or function. The scope resolution opeator is used for following purposes.

1. To access a global variable when there is a local variable with same name
2. It defines the member function outside of the class
3. to access the static variable and static function of a class
4. In case of multiple Inheritance:If same variable name exists in two ancestor classes, we can use scope resolution operator to distinguish.
5. Refer to a class inside another class:If a class exists inside another class we can use the nesting class to refer the nested class using the scope 
   resolution operator
