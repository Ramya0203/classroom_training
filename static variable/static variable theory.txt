When the static keyword preceded the declaration of a variable, that variable becomes a static variable.

Syntax:
static <type> <variable_name>;

A static keyword serves a different purpose depending on where it has been declared.

If it is declared inside of a class, all instances of the class (i.e. objects) will share the same copy of the variable, and we can access it without any object by 
class name outside the class.

If it is declared inside of a function then its value is preserved between successive calls for the lifetime of the program, but it cannot be accessd outside the 
scope or function in which it is declared.
